# Visitor-Management-System
***
A Visitor Management System (VMS) is to systematically track and keep the record of visitors that 
visited a secured area in a given time.  Digitizing the VMS to replace the use of paper-based solution 
help in retrieval of information and securing data collected efficiently. Features such as parking lot 
booking shall be implemented too. Additional analytics such as peak operation hour of visitors will be 
needed to help distinguish your proposed VMS as compared to the established conventional software 
in the market.

# Introduction
***
Security: 

The security department is responsible for ensuring the security and safety of the 
hospital. The duties of a hospital security officer include monitoring entrances (View 
All Visitors) and maintaining security systems (Manage User).

User: 

The user is the hospital customer service such as the front desk staff which refers 
to the customer support and care given to people by a hospital. They are dealing with 
visitor information (CRUD Visitor) and parking lot booking (CRUD Reservation).

Visitor: 

Visitors are the ones that will be visiting the hospital at a specific time. Each visitor 
shall only book a parking lot and confirm all of the data entered by the user (View 
Visitor and Reservation Info).

# About Project
***
Our team is required to develop the backend solution for a VMS based on the use-case diagram. The job scopes include (but not limited):
- Design the database model using MongoDB
- Secure the database system
- Deploy the backend server using NodeJs
- Develop all the relevant RESTful API secured with authentication and authorization
- Github progress and API documentation

At the end of the project, a very short but attractive commercial video needs to be produced which including introduction of our project, cloud and database and demonstration of the functionality of your solution. This includes:
- The database model
- A database hosted on Mongo Atlas
- The RESTful API Sequence Diagram
- A RESTful server that handles all the request from client

# Conclusion
As for our summary, Visitor Management System (VMS) records and tracks the number of visitors who enter a secure area at a particular time. In our situation, we've chosen the hospital as our secure location, and we'll be using the VMS to replace paper-based operations with digital procedures. We use MongoDB, Visual Studio Code, and the GitHub library to relate to the retrieval of information and safeguarding of data acquired efficiently. We opted to include services such as parking lot booking, as well as extra metrics such as peak visitor hours of operation in our project.
For security reasons, we have enhanced the security of our proposed system by using encryption, authentication, and authorization. All possible exception handlings are properly implemented and tested to avoid the malfunction of our source codes. To make our product more commercial in the market, we did the analysis of peak hours of visiting time which is during lunchtime (12 p.m. until 1 p.m.) and off work time (6 p.m. until 7 p.m.).
